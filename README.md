## Sample application demonstrating Auth0, Grails 3, and spring security integration for a Java Spring MVC application

This is a companion sample for the [Auth0 Spring Security MVC](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spring-security-mvc) library.
Please refer to that library and documentation for further information specific to the library itself.

This sample application shows you how to:

 1. Configure and run your Grails 3 application with Auth0 (Lock or Auth0.js) and Spring Security
 2. 100% Java Configuration (Annotations)
 3. Secure one or more URL endpoints with Role / Authority based permissions (ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN etc)
 4. Secure Java Services using method level security annotations for role based access control

Let's get started - it only takes a few minutes to have a working application with all the above.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this example you will need to have Java 7+, and Grails 3 installed.

Check the [Grails](https://grails.org/) documentation for details on installing `Grails 3`.
[sdkman](http://sdkman.io/) is one useful tool for this purpose.

Check installed successfully with:

```sh
grails --version
```

FYI only, in creating this sample, the following SDK versions were used:

 ```
Grails Version: 3.1.9
Groovy Version: 2.4.7
JVM Version: 1.8.0_77
 ```

### Setup

Create an [Auth0 Account](https://auth0.com) (if not already done so - free!).


#### From the Auth0 Dashboard

Create an application - for the purposes of this sample - `app`

Ensure you add the following to the settings.

Allowed Callback URL:

```
http://localhost:3099/callback
```

Ensure you add the following to the settings.

Allowed Logout URLs:

```
http://localhost:3099/logout
```

Add one or more `connections` to your application - for instance Google Social Connection,
or username-password DB connection.


###### Add Role Based Authorization By Creating an Auth0 Rule


Since this sample applies Role based authorization on the Home Page (defaults to requiring `ROLE_ADMIN`), go to `Rules`
and create the following new Rule:

```
function (user, context, callback) {
  user.app_metadata = user.app_metadata || {};
  // You can add a Role based on what you want
  // Here, we simply check domain
  var addRolesToUser = function(user, cb) {
    if (user.email.indexOf('@gmail.com') > -1) {
      cb(null, ['ROLE_ADMIN']);
   } else if (user.email.indexOf('@auth0.com') > -1) {
      cb(null, ['ROLE_ADMIN']);
    } else {
      cb(null, ['ROLE_USER']);
    }
  };

  addRolesToUser(user, function(err, roles) {
    if (err) {
      callback(err);
    } else {
      user.app_metadata.roles = roles;
      auth0.users.updateAppMetadata(user.user_id, user.app_metadata)
        .then(function(){
          callback(null, user, context);
        })
        .catch(function(err){
          callback(err);
        });
    }
  });
}
```

In our simple Rule above, we add `ROLE_ADMIN` to any user profiles whose email addresses are `gmail.com` and `auth0.com` domains.
Otherwise, we only provide `ROLE_USER` role. Our Spring Security Sample app will read this information from the UserProfile and apply
the granted authorities when checking authorization access to secured endpoints configured with Role based permissions

Here is our sample `AppConfig` entry where we specify the endpoints security settings -
defined under `src/com.auth0.example.AppConfig.java`


```
  // Apply the Authentication and Authorization Strategies your application endpoints require
        http
                .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/css/**", "/fonts/**", "/js/**", "/login").permitAll()
                .antMatchers("/portal/**").hasAnyAuthority("ROLE_USER", "ROLE_ADMIN")
//                .antMatchers("/portal/**").hasAuthority("ROLE_ADMIN")
                .antMatchers(getSecuredRoute()).authenticated();
```

Here, we only allow users with `ROLE_USER` or `ROLE_ADMIN` to access the home page.


### Inside the Application - update configuration information

Enter your:

`client_id`, `client_secret`, and `domain` information into `grails-app/conf/auth0.properties`

Note: There are two properties in `auth0.properties` that you do not need to touch. Leave values as `false`

`auth0.servletFilterEnabled: false` - this ensures we don't autowire the ServletFilter defined in an Auth0 dependency
library.

`auth0.defaultAuth0WebSecurityEnabled: false` - this ensures we do not autowire the default configuration file
provided with the `auth0-spring-security-mvc` library itself. That is a default configuration suitable only for
simpler applications seeking to have an out of the box secured endpoint URL - similar to `auth0-servlet` library.

For details on the other settings, please check the README for the library this sample depends on  [Auth0 Spring Security MVC](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spring-security-mvc).
In particular, [this section on defalut configuration](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spring-security-mvc#default-configuration) which lists each property together with a
description on its purpose.

### Build and Run

In order to build and run the project execute:

```sh
gradle bootRun
```

Then, go to [http://localhost:3099/](http://localhost:3099/).

The Grails landing page has been left with the sample so you can see the Controllers used, and get general information
on the Grails application itself. Since it launches from the root URL it is unsecured and hence available on startup.

To login, go to [http://localhost:3099/login](http://localhost:3099/login) - you can click on the LoginController link if you like.
